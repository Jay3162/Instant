# **Description**

## Ecommerce-site is based on Amazon's design and features that display products and allows users to add them to a basket before letting them place an order. 

## Makes use of two APIs:
### - The first provides all of the information related to the site's products, from images to descriptions and even a star rating.
### - The second is Firebase which handles user registration, logins and logouts. 
Once a product is clicked the user is shown more information about the item they've selected and can add the merchandise to their basket. Once ready they can view the basket and click the checkout button to see all of their items on an orders page.
I make use of React-Router to redirect across the site and to send data to certain pages. Alongside that, I make use of the local storage to help send product data throughout the site.
